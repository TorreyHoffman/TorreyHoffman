- 👋 Hi, I’m @TorreyHoffman. I work for Google. Since 2021 I've been on the Geometry team, which is responsible for the open-source S2 library as well
as several internal Google systems. Before joining Geometry, I worked for over 10 years in other parts of Google Geo: Pathfinder (driving, walking, & biking directions), data quality of addresses, the ranking and selection of labels for the map, and various other projects. 
 - 👨‍🏭 My main task is improving the Java port of S2 and supporting its use within Google.
I have ported and written functionality for the Java implementation that was formerly only present in the C++ implementation. I've also improved the test coverage and added benchmarks to the Java port, fixed bugs, improved performance, and added documentation. The docs are mostly Google internal at the moment but I plan to make much of that available externally as well. 
- 👀 Outside of work, I’m interested in procedural generation, geology, biology, and 3D graphics. I'm especially interested in historical geology
& biology, like what the earth was like during and just after the last ice age. This includes modeling geological processes like erosion, mountain
formation, river deltas, etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#. As a personal project, I'm also porting the S2 Geometry Library from C++ and Java to C#, and using that 
as part of the foundation for procedural generation of realistic worlds.
