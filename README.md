- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @TorreyHoffman.
- I work for Google, on the Geometry team. I just joined Geometry after about 10 years working in other parts of Google Geo. 
My main task at work now (Q4 2021 and continuing into 2022) is improving the Java port of S2. 
I'm porting and writing functionality for the Java implementation that's currently only present in C++. I'm also improving test coverage and adding
benchmarks to the Java port, improving performance, and adding documentation. I expect most of my current work will show up in the open-source 
release of Java S2 in 2022.
- ðŸ‘€ Outside of work, Iâ€™m interested in procedural generation, geology, biology, and 3D graphics. I'm especially interested in historical geology
& biology, like what the earth was like during and just after the last ice age. This includes modeling geological processes like erosion, mountain
formation, river deltas, etc.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C#. As a personal project, I'm also porting the S2 Geometry Library from C++ and Java to C#, and using that 
as part of the foundation for procedural generation of realistic worlds. 
- ðŸ“« You can reach me at work as "torrey" at google.com, or personally as torrey at torreyhoffman.com.
