- 👋 Hi, I’m @TorreyHoffman. I'm recently ex-Google, and now working on some personal projects (not announced yet).
- 👀 I’m interested in procedural generation, geology, biology, and 3D graphics. I'm experimenting with modeling
- geological processes like erosion, mountain formation, river deltas, etc.
- From 2021 to 2025, I worked on Google's Geometry team, which is responsible for the open-source S2 library as well
as several internal Google systems. Before joining Geometry, I worked for over 10 years in other parts of Google Geo:
Pathfinder (driving, walking, & biking directions), data quality of addresses, the ranking and selection of labels
for the map, and various other projects. 
 - 👨‍🏭 My main task on the Geometry team was improving the Java port of S2 and supporting its use within Google.
I ported and wrote features for the Java implementation that were formerly only present in the C++ implementation.
I've also improved the test coverage and added benchmarks to the Java port, fixed bugs, improved performance, and
added documentation. 
- 🌱 I also ported the core features of the S2 Geometry Library from C++ and Java to C# so I could use it in Unity.
