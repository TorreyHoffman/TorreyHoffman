- 👋 Hi, I’m @TorreyHoffman. I work for Google, and recently joined the Geometry team, which is responsible for the open-source S2 library as well
as several internal Google systems. Before joining Geometry, I worked for over 10 years in other parts of Google Geo: Pathfinder (driving, walking, & biking directions), data quality of addresses, the ranking and selection of labels for the map, and various other projects. 
 - 👨‍🏭 My main task at work since Q4 2021, and continuing into 2022 is improving the Java port of S2. 
I'm porting and writing functionality for the Java implementation that's currently only present in C++, 
and making fixes and other improvements in the C++ port along the way.
I'm also improving test coverage and adding benchmarks to the Java port, improving performance, and adding documentation. 
I expect most of my current work will show up in the open-source release of Java S2 in 2022.
- 👀 Outside of work, I’m interested in procedural generation, geology, biology, and 3D graphics. I'm especially interested in historical geology
& biology, like what the earth was like during and just after the last ice age. This includes modeling geological processes like erosion, mountain
formation, river deltas, etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#. As a personal project, I'm also porting the S2 Geometry Library from C++ and Java to C#, and using that 
as part of the foundation for procedural generation of realistic worlds.
